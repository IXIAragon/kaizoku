Spice is what makes the world clearer...
all I see is rot... all beneath the surface...
These abyssariads thinks they are GODS. THEY ARE JUST DEMONS IN DISGUISE!!!
They never know hunger or pain... they ate goblin meat, like cannibals.
The RICH feasts while we starve. Their WEAPONS won't save them from the darkness below.
Do you hear it...? The whispers.
The so called Abyssariad protection is just another chain on my neck. But I don't want to die to orcs...
Spice just opens your mind... take it, sniff it, make sex with it...
They sit in their ivory towers, blind to the suffering they cause... those towers will crumble one day.
The sea is a is a harsh mistress, but even she shows more mercy than these Abyssariads.
The zamurai play their games, but they don't see the shadows closing in.
spice... flows through me... hewhhe.. it flows... yes, please... flow harder...
They call us vermins...
Are we really vermins?
The abyssariad's powers is just a fragile illusion.
One spark, and it will all burn away.
The sewerfolk give us pleasure... all this spice... it fries my brain.
The tides will wash away the false gods and their golden idols.
The refuse of the world...
We can! We can ignite a revolution!
The spice... it connects us to the older god... the most old god...
I can see a woman with a cone in the head.
The Abyssariads believes themselves to be untouchable, but even gods can fall.
